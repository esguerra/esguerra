I'm an assistant professor at the Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology <a href="https://drug.ku.dk/staff/?pure=en/persons/673375">(ILF)</a> at the <a href="https://www.ku.dk">University of Copenhagen</a>, Denmark. Using tools from computational chemistry I have explored the behavior of biopolymers, in particular RNA, triple-helical DNA and G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR's). This research has taken me from my native Bogot√°, Colombia, to New Jersey, U.S.A, then to Stockholm, Sweden, and now to Copenhagen, Denmark.
I have a long standing interest in computational methods which started back home while taking our core course in Numerical Methods at the <a href="https://unal.edu.co">Universidad Nacional de Colombia</a> by professor Oswaldo Lezama.
